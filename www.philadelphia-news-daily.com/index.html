<p><a href="http://www.philadelphia-news-daily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/581471_10151500329543569_1403692109_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5" title="581471_10151500329543569_1403692109_n" src="http://www.philadelphia-news-daily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/581471_10151500329543569_1403692109_n.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="403" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A massive hurricane is said to hit the region of Philadelphia, as announced by Gary Szatkowski, the chief meteorologist of National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Szatkowski admitted that he was reluctant prior to his terrifying news about the amassing of the tropical storm which they named Sandy.</p>
<p>As seen by the National Weather Service, Sandy is 330 miles south of Jamaica and is moving almost stealthily with a speed of 5 miles per hour. It is said to hit Philadelphia some time on Sunday.</p>
<p>The head of the weather bureau even questioned himself upon pushing the button on the alert to the emergency managers of the region, yet he puts his trust in the state-of-the-art facilities and forecast models created by the Europeans and advises the people to prepare for a potentially colossal hit.</p>
<p>“Sandy looks like a good one,” Szatkowski added.</p>
<p>The government adds that Hurricane Sandy has a capacity to turn into a “Frankenstorm,” which can greatly shake the entire population corridor of Mid-Atlantic-Northeast with intensive gale, flooding rains, and mammoth waves from Sunday until Holloween.</p>
<p>“If this pans out, people will be remembering and talking about this a decade from now, “ said Szatkowski.</p>
<p>Meteorologists also forecast Sandy to interact with a cold front that is crossing the East of the region, potentially creating a devastating “hybrid” which can turn into a tropical beast.</p>
<p>With lower water level in the rivers and streams, the full impact of Hurricane Sandy might not be visible until Monday or Tuesday, but it already has produced numerous days of terror.</p>
<p>Rescue teams and organizations such as Red Cross, AAA, Salvation Army, and the emergency managers of the county have heightened their alarm signals. Meteorologists from commercial and private organizations are predicting that Sandy would likely cause at least $1 billion of damage.</p>
<p>“This is a threat,” claims Szatkowski.</p>
